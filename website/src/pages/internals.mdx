# How kabelsalat works

This site explains how kabelsalat works under the hood. **You don't need to know this to use it!**

## Overview

The understand how kabelsalat works, we need to understand how the user code
is transformed to produce audio in the end. These are the basic steps:

1. User evaluates code
2. The code creates a `Node` representing the audio graph
3. The `Node` is compiled to an optimized chunk audio callback code
4. The code is sent to the audio thread
5. The audio thread creates the required `AudioNode`'s and runs the code for each audio sample

## From Code to Graph

Let's look at this example:

<MiniRepl
  code={`sine(200)
.debug(n=>JSON.stringify(n,null,2))
.out()`}
  client:visible="solid"
/>

If you run the above patch, the `log` method will output this:

```json
{
  "type": "Sine",
  "ins": [
    {
      "type": "n",
      "value": 200,
      "ins": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Here we see the basic structure of a `Node` in kabelsalat:

- type: which kind of node is it?
- ins: which `Node`'s are connected to it?

We can also see that the number passed to `sine` is converted to a `Node` of type `n`, which is the constant number node.
It is special because it also has a `value` property.

The clever thing about this data structure is that you only need to know the last `Node` (before .out) to know the whole graph!

### Method Chaining vs Function Calling

kabelsalat relies heavily on method chaining, which is only syntax sugar for regular function calls. These 2 variants are equivalent:

```js
mul(sine(200), 0.5);
// is equal to
sine(200).mul(0.5);
```

This will work for any node (except `out`, which is a special case). More generally, you can say

```
a.x(b) = x(a,b)
```

This syntax sugar reduces the level of parenthesis nesting alot and is also more natural way to express arithmetic:

```js
3 * 4; // infix notation
// =
n(3).mul(4); // method chaining
// =
mul(3, 4); // polish notation
```

So you could say the method chaining syntax acts as an infix operator replacement.

## Compiling the Graph

In the next stage, we pass the graph to the compiler, which turns it into a sequence of instructions that runs well on the audio thread.
Before actual compilation there is preprocessing step:

1. flatten the `Node`s
2. apply topological sort

### Flatten Node's

This step takes the last `Node` and turns it into an Array of `Node`'s where, the `ins` are replaced with indices:

<MiniRepl
  code={`const graph = sine(200).mul(.5)
console.log('flat graph', JSON.stringify(graph.flatten(),null,2))
graph.out()`}
  client:visible="solid"
/>

This is the console output:

```json
[
  // 0
  {
    "type": "mul",
    "ins": ["1", "3"]
  },
  // 1
  {
    "type": "Sine",
    "ins": ["2"]
  },
  // 2
  {
    "type": "n",
    "ins": [],
    "value": 200
  },
  // 3
  {
    "type": "n",
    "ins": [],
    "value": 0.5
  }
]
```

This representation of the graph contains the same info, but structured in a way suitable for...

### Topological Sort

[Topological Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) makes sure the `Node`s are ordered so that nodes without dependencies are first.

<MiniRepl
  code={`const graph = sine(200).mul(.5)
const flat = graph.flatten()
console.log('sorted', JSON.stringify(topoSort(flat),null,2))
graph.out()`}
  client:visible="solid"
/>

This gives us:

```json
["3", "2", "1", "0"]
```

Reordering the flattened nodes in this order:

```json
[
  // 3
  {
    "type": "n",
    "ins": [],
    "value": 0.5
  }
  // 2
  {
    "type": "n",
    "ins": [],
    "value": 200
  },
  // 1
  {
    "type": "Sine",
    "ins": ["2"]
  },
  // 0
  {
    "type": "mul",
    "ins": ["1", "3"]
  },
]
```

We can now observe that the `ins` of each `Node` preceed the `Node` itself, which means it's time to generate some code..

### Compilation

The compiler can now generate a chunk of code, where each line roughly corresponds to the value of one Node:

<MiniRepl
  code={`const graph = sine(200).mul(.5)
console.log(compile(graph))
graph.out()`}
  client:visible="solid"
/>

The compiler gives us this compiled `unit`:

```js
{
    "src": "const n1 = nodes[0].update(200, 0); /* Sine */\nconst n0 = n1 * 0.5; /* Sine * n */\nreturn [(0*0.3), (0*0.3)]",
    "ugens": ["Sine"]
}
```

Let's make the `src` more readable:

```js
const n1 = nodes[0].update(200, 0); /* Sine */
const n0 = n1 * 0.5; /* Sine * n */
return [n0 * 0.3, n0 * 0.3];
```

This is now the actual code that runs on the audio thread.

- The `n` variable numbers correspond to the original indices of the topologically sorted Array.
- To shorten the output, the compiler inlines arithmetic Node's (add, mul,...) and constant numbers (n).
- For `AudioNode`'s like `Sine`, the compiler inserts an `update` call with its inputs as arguments (they could also be variables).
- In the end we just get 2 numbers for the left and right speaker.

## Running the Compiled Code

The `unit` returned by the compiler is sent to our `GraphWorklet` which hosts an instance of `AudioGraph`.
The `AudioGraph` creates an `AudioNode` for each `type` in the `ugens` Array.
Each `AudioNode` has the ability to keep its own state, for example, `Sine` will keep track of its phase.
The compiled `src` is used as the body of the `_genSample` function, which is ultimately called in `GraphWorklet.process` for each sample.

## Credits

This is the basic mechanism! It is heavily influenced by the amazing [noisecraft](https://noisecraft.app/) by Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert.
The audio DSP code is mostly borrowed as is, but I've written a new compiler + implemented feedback and multichannel expansion + removed UI related features.
You can read more about the specific changes in this [discussion](https://github.com/maximecb/noisecraft/discussions/109)

Other influences include [genish.js](https://www.charlie-roberts.com/genish/) and [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
Also thanks alot to [Bubo](https://github.com/Bubobubobubobubo) for his invaluable feedback!

## More

What I haven't described so far:

- how feedback is resolved
- how multichannel expansion works
- how the viz works

I might write about it in the future
